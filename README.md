# AI-Powered Dynamic Response System Using Spring AI

## Description
This project is an advanced AI-powered application developed using **Spring AI** and **Spring Boot**. It generates intelligent and dynamic responses based on user input, leveraging AI models such as GPT for context-aware interactions. The system can be adapted for various use cases, such as customer support, content creation, or task automation.

The project uses multiple prompts and templates to fine-tune AI outputs, ensuring the generated responses are relevant and useful for different scenarios. It also provides REST APIs to integrate AI-powered responses with external applications, offering a scalable and customizable solution.
